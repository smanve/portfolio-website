Hi, I'm Manvendra! I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating innovative solutions that bring about positive impact. I have experience in various programming languages and frameworks, including Python, C++, JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

I am currently in my final year of my software engineering degree and have experience working in the industry as a software engineering intern. Apart from my professional experience, I have also undertaken several projects while studying at university. I enjoy tackling complex problems and thrive in collaborative environments.

In my free time, I'm currently revising Data Structures and Algorithms and exploring AI and ML technologies. When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, creative writing, gaming, and traveling!

Feel free to browse my portfolio website to learn more about my work and projects. If you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:msin0017@student.monash.edu).

Thank you for visiting!
